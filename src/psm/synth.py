"""Generate synthetic (syn_) fields for the E19 target schema.

Fills the 28 columns schema/e19_target.yaml's E19 target shape needs that
BSEE never publishes — see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-synth-fields-
design.md (rev 2) for the design and docs/_synth.md for the plain-language
version. Every rule here is deterministic: int(sha256(report_id + salt), 16)
% N for anything needing variety, and a frozen reference_date (never
date.today()) for anything age-dependent. schema/synth_rules.yaml holds
every threshold — this module must not hardcode one.
